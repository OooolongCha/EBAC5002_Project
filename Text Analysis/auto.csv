Here today, we have a unique car commercial for you guys. A commercial that features the Pontiac lineup for 1991, with the voice of Patrick Stewart narrating over the commercial! Some of the vehicles featured in this commercial are already talked about in my other car commercial videos like the LeMans and Bonneville, so I'll talk about the Pontiac Grand Prix featured in this commercial. \n\nThe Grand Prix had a base 3.1 Liter, 6 cylinder engine that produced 140 horsepower at 4400 RPM with 185 LB-FT of Torque at 3200 RPM. A more powerful 3.4 Liter V6 that produced 210 Horsepower was available as an option.\n\nThe base transmission  on the Grand Prix was a 3 speed automatic, with a 4 speed automatic and 5 speed manual being available as options. Fuel mileage with the optional 4 speed automatic was a decent 17 MPG city, 28 MPG highway. \n\nTwo body styles were offered on the Grand Prix; a 2 door coupe or 4 door sedan. The GT model trim only came in a 2 door coupe.\n \nThree trim levels were offered on the Grand Prix; the LE base trim, the SE mid range trim, the more luxurious STE model trim, and the sport oriented GT trim. The MSRP for the LE entry level trim in a 4 door sedan layout was $14,779, the MSRP for the SE mid range trim was $15,769, the MSRP for the luxury STE model trim in a 4 door layout was $20,479 and the MSRP for the 2 door GT coupe was $19,369.\n\nIf you wanted a modestly priced sport oriented 2 and 4 door vehicle that was Domestic, provided somewhat good performance, matched with decent gas mileage and sleek looks in 1991, then the Pontiac Grand Prix was the car for you.\n\nThere are many more old car commercials uploaded on my channel and many more to come, so check my channel often for more videos!\n\n(Disclosure: I do not own this old car advertisement commercial as it belongs to the General Motors Automobile Corporation.)",826,0.9583333333333334,0.0049566294919454,0.0012391573729863,1,Autos & Vehicles,commerical

It's a simple question, though the answer is quite complicated. And it varies tremendously based on what car we're talking about. A $20,000 compact is far more simple than the $155,000 Mercedes S560 Cabriolet driven in this video. With that extra cost comes luxuriousness, the latest technology, and all kinds of features that most drivers will never even know the car has. \n\nOften, complexity is associated with unreliability, and though they may often correlate, that doesn't mean complexity causes unreliability. In the case of luxury cars, it's important to consider who the buyer is. In this video, we'll discuss why it may be a win-win for both manufacturers and consumers to have expensive cars that aren't necessarily reliable. \n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nOfficial Website: http://www.howdoesacarwork.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nCar Throttle: https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!",16,0.9256363478411954,0.0231587291368238,0.004323526098083,1,Autos & Vehicles,great cars series

With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019. The company is currently taking reservations for the semi, but a deposit will set buyers back $5,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/",5,0.9324379324379324,0.0117516934611176,0.003746240904933,1,Autos & Vehicles,great cars series

Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept.

In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\n\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150",5,0.9237455551165548,0.0168107599490784,0.0040582277079758,1,Autos & Vehicles,great cars series

General Motors didn’t share details on the diesel’s power output, but head of GM product development, Mark Reuss, assured us it would be more powerful than Ford’s new diesel in the F-150. The diesel and the 6.2 will be available with GM’s new Hydramatic 10-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.3 will come with the eight-speed.\n\nThe significant 450 lbs in weight savings come thanks to the use of aluminum in the hood, doors and rear liftgate. The vehicle’s ‘safety cage’ also uses seven different grades of steel to offer a good mix of lightness and strength. Furthermore, the front upper control arms are made of aluminum, while the rear springs are made of a new carbon-composite material, which shaves more pounds from the pickup.\n\nSubscribe\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=AutoGuideVideo\n\nYouTube - http://www.youtube.com/user/AutoguideVideo\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/AutoGuide\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/AutoGuide\nGoogle+ - http://goo.gl/LBxsP\nWeb - http://www.AutoGuide.com\n\nAutoGuide reviews the latest new cars with test drives, car comparisons and shootouts plus coverage of breaking auto industry news, auto shows, rumors and spy photos.
